When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When using multiple computers and traveling.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	You may be working on a new update that's ahead in commits from the remote and if github automatically updates your local, you can lose all your progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks: 
		Cloning a repository that you want to contribute to but not affect the original repository
	Clones: 
		Copying a repository from GitHub to your local
	Branches: 
		when working on multiple versions of a single project
		
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The remote may be a working production version of the project. If you are make big changes or update on the local, having the last known state can help reverting back if the update cause significant errors.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	You have to have multiple files on different computers then when you would want to merge different versions you would have to do it manual line by line. 
	Easier: Easier to talk one on one with someone about updates and experimental projects
	Harder: Merging, viewing changes, and changing things logically, keeping up with different changes, can't revert back to a pervious version.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	If more than one collabortors are working on a project and are working on different updates or even the same updates. The person/team in charge of the project would be able to check if there are any conflicts between the updates or collaborations and merge them when they are able to.
