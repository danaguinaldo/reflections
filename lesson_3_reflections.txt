When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When using multiple computers and traveling.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	You may be working on a new update that's ahead in commits from the remote and if github automatically updates your local, you can lose all your progress.
