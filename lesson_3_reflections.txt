When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When using multiple computers and traveling.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	You may be working on a new update that's ahead in commits from the remote and if github automatically updates your local, you can lose all your progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks: 
		Cloning a repository that you want to contribute to but not affect the original repository
	Clones: 
		Copying a repository from GitHub to your local
	Branches: 
		when working on multiple versions of a single project
		
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The remote may be a working production version of the project. If you are make big changes or update on the local, having the last known state can help reverting back if the update cause significant errors.
