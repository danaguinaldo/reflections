How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It helped show where new code was added or old code was deleted.
	By seeing that you could see if there was a typo in the new code or there was something valuable that was deleted.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	Able to catch mistakes more quickly and allows you to revert back to a working version in case your updated version needs more work.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Saved versions are more meaningful. Not too many small files with little change. 
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Easier, less work, allow for more meaningful updates with each commit
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	A lot easier to see which code was added/deleted when error occured
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	
	Reassured that you can revert to an older version or even find the bug through git
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	
	Creating software/games/web pages
